# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

the code is organized into separate functions, enhancing clarity and readability. Here's a brief description of the improvements:

- Simplified flow: The nested if statements in the original code are replaced with a more linear control flow. The determineCandidate function is used to determine the candidate value based on the provided event. If the candidate is not a string, it is stringified. Then, the length of the candidate is checked, and if it exceeds the maximum length, it is hashed. This simplified flow makes it easier to follow the code logic.

- Efficiency: Redundant checks are eliminated, improving efficiency and reducing cognitive load.

- Improved Naming: The function names (determineCandidate and hashKey) provide clear descriptions of their respective actions. This enhances the readability of the code by allowing developers to quickly grasp the purpose of each function.

- Modularization: The logic for determining the candidate and hashing the key is encapsulated within separate functions (determineCandidate and hashKey). Each function has a clear purpose, leading to better code organization and easier understanding of each step of the process.
